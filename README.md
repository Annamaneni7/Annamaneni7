Hey I'm Swathi Annamaneni, a junior at University of Wisconsin-Madison.

I am a student who codes in Java and Python for classes and uses Javascript to create art later after school.

I am a full-stack web developer exploring every track possible from my vantage point. I started off with Javascript, delved into all the plethora of libraries and frameworks that use Javascript to build applications for both Desktop and mobile. I'm currently on a ride to finishing up an AR/VR project using Javascript using Viro React.
